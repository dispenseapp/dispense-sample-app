./src/components/Glider.tsx
146:29  Warning: The ref value 'gliderContainerRef.current' will likely have changed by the time this effect cleanup function runs. If this ref points to a node rendered by React, copy 'gliderContainerRef.current' to a variable inside the effect, and use that variable in the cleanup function.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
149:6  Warning: React Hook React.useEffect has a missing dependency: 'props.autoplay'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./src/hooks/useKeyPress.ts
18:6  Warning: React Hook React.useEffect has missing dependencies: 'key' and 'onKeyPress'. Either include them or remove the dependency array. If 'onKeyPress' changes too often, find the parent component that defines it and wrap that definition in useCallback.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
